Make 3 attempts at each of the following:
Max set of single-leg squats on your left leg.
Max set of single-leg squats on your right leg.
Max set of left-arm dumbbell snatches (touch-and-go).
Max set of right-arm dumbbell snatches (touch-and-go).
Max set of strict toes-to-bars.
For the squats, a set ends when your opposite foot touches the ground or you rest excessively at the top. For the snatch, use the heaviest dumbbell that you can find and still get at least 3 reps. Warm up for each and rest as needed between efforts.
Post reps (and load) completed for each set to comments.

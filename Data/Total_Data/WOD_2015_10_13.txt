Scooter
On a 35-minute clock with a partner:
Complete as many rounds as possible in 30 minutes of:
30 double-unders
15 pull-ups
15 push-ups
100-meter sprint
Then, 5 minutes to find a 1-rep-max partner deadlift
For the AMRAP, have one partner work while the other rests, switching after a full round is completed. If you're performing without a partner, rest 60 seconds between each round, and find a regular 1-rep-max deadlift.

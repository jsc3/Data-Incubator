4 x 5 x (Cln+FS+PP+BS+PP+OHS)
This complex is a clean right into a front squat into a push press into a back squat into a (wide grip) push press into an overhead squat. The clean, the three squats, and the two push-presses constitute 'one' rep.
The notation “4 x 5 x (Cln+FS+PP+BS+PP+OHS)” indicates four sets of five 'reps.' This complex comes to us from Lincoln Brigham. Thanks, Lincoln!
Rest as needed between sets.

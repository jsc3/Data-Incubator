"Chelsea"
Set up before a clock, and every minute, on the minute, perform 5 pull-ups, 10 push-ups, and 15 squats.
Can you continue for thirty minutes? Twenty? How about 10? 
We last saw this workout August 3rd, and it will be making repeated, irregular, appearances in the "Workout of the Day." This and other "benchmark" workouts will be readily distinguished from other Workouts of the Day by their being given, in each instance, a female name. This is "Chelsea." The benchmark series - there will be many - will serve to measure your performance and improvements.
If on last tackling "Chelsea" you went the full thirty minutes, try this time 6 pull-ups, 11 push-ups, and 16 squats, and if successful, add one rep to each exercise each time "Chelsea" appears.
Your September, 2003 CrossFit Journal details the benchmark workout concept and introduces the first six "girls:" Angie, Barbara, Chelsea, Diane, Elizabeth, and Fran.

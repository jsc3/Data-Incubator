155 pound Squat Clean and Jerk, 30 reps
The barbell goes from ground to overhead, passing through a front squat in which the crease of the hip passes below the height of the kneecap. The finish position is with the arms, hips and knees fully extended, arms overhead, with at least a portion of the ear visible in front of the arm. Dropping the barbell is acceptable.
Austin Malleolo 3:01, Camille Leblanc-Bazinet 3:53 (105lbs).

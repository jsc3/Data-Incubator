Five rounds for time of:
3 Muscle-up Handstand push-ups
10 Burpee pull-ups
Ideally, the pull-up bar is one foot above your reach. If you cannot do the muscle-up handstand push-ups, do 7 muscle-ups and 12 handstand push-ups each round.
Austin Malleolo 12:53, Pat Barber 13:09, Chris Spealler 14:53 (5 MU-HSPU per round), Pat Burke 15:21, Peter Egyed 15:22, TJ Barber 16:23, Dave Leys 18:11, Matt Chan 18:27, Rob Orlando 18:31 (burpee rope pull-up), Kristan Clever 24:37.

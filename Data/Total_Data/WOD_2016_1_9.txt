In this workout, you move from each of five stations after a minute. The clock does not reset or stop between exercises. After the first 5-minute round, take a 1-minute break before repeating. On call of "rotate," the athletes must move to next station immediately for best score. One point is given for each rep, except on the rower where each calorie is 1 point.

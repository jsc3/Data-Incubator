Five rounds for time of:
30 Jump rope double-unders
30 Sit-ups
30 Squats
If you can't double under cut your losses at 2 minutes of jumping rope furiously. Sit-ups can be done on glute-ham developer (GHD), Roman Chair, Ab Mat, or as Knees-to-elbows on pull-up bar. Post time and needed modifications to comments.

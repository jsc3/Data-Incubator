Tabata push-ups
Run 2 miles
Bottom-to-bottom Tabata squats
The Tabata interval is 20 seconds of work followed by 10 seconds of rest for 8 intervals. Avoid lousy push-ups (see CFJ 7). For the Tabata squats, remain in the bottom position for the rest intervals, and immediately return to the bottom position after full extension. No resting at the top.
Post total number of push-ups, time to complete the run and total number of squats completed to comments.

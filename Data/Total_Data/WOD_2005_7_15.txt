Three rounds for time of:
95 pound barbell Snatch, 21 reps
15 foot Rope-climb, two ascents, without legs, from seated start
If you donï¿½t have a rope, make plans to pick one up, and until then, substitute 20 pull-ups for each ascent. Snatch is squat snatch, not power snatch.
Post any needed modifications and time to completion to comments.

Weighted walking lunge/push-press for 400 meters.
Four lunge steps, alternating legs, followed by 5 reps of push-press repeated through 400 meters. Rack and press from back, front, or alternate at will. Rest when and where needed but clock keeps running.
Divide load carried (pounds) by time to completion (seconds) and post to comments.

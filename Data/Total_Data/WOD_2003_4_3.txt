Complete three rounds for time:
Run 400 meters
Deadlift bodyweight X 15 reps
24” Box Jump X 20 reps
This workout contains three different functional applications of hip extension. Note the seeming incompatibility of these movements. The benefit here is largely a function of pace or total time – don’t dally!

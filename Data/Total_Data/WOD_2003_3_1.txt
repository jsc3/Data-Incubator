If you are doing something you do not enjoy,
such as a certain type of work because you
need the money for school, your family, or whatever,
and find yourself complaining and feeling hard
done by, then you are enduring a life of conflict.
You either have to change your thinking or your job.
When you choose to do something for a certain
benefit such as money, complaining while you are
doing it is, of course, a waste of energy and time
and is self-destructive.

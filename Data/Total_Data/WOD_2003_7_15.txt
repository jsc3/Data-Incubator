Inman Mile
From the U.S. All-Round Weightlifting Association, USAWA: “The lifter will have loaded onto his/her shoulders a weight equal to 150% of bodyweight. The lifter will then carry the weight a distance of one mile. Gait is optional. Resting is allowed, but neither the lifter nor the weight may be supported. Records will be kept in both pounds and time. Should the weight be touched by any aide once the lift has begun, the event is terminated. The lifter may be handed refreshments during the lift.”
This is hard, and for many impossible. Start with 150% of bodyweight and see how far you can take it. Then, if not able to make the mile, rest and start again with largest load you estimate can be carried for a mile regardless of time.

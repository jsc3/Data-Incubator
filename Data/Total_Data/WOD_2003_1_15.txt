Notes:

For 1in/1out, set watch to continuous
countdown mode for one minute. It will beep
every minute in this mode. Start run and
make mental note of location at turn around.
Push hard enough that you cannot make it
back in one minute, i.e., done right you
come in "late."
Work with toughest Kettlebell you can
for all three sets.
Try for same one minute "outspot" on
second run. Again record time "late" on return.
Compare to first run.
If you don't want to run substitute
500 meter row or 5 minutes stairclimb
or 5 minute cycle.

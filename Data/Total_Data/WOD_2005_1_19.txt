15,12, and 9 rep rounds of:
Dumbbell Thruster
Pull-ups
For the Thrusters use a pair of dumbbells with each dumbbellÂ’s weight equivalent to 1/5 your bodyweight. Weight your pull-ups with one of the dumbbells used for the Thrusters. Placing the dumbbell between the legs above crossed ankles works great.

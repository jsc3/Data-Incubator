135 pound Sumo deadlift high-pull
Pull to inverted hang and lower as slowly as possible
On SDHP's, pull the bar to make contact under the chin. On pulls to inverted hang, keep arms, trunk, hips, and legs as straight as possible, both up and down. This is not for time.
The SDHP is a "pull" that is really a "push." Can you elaborate?

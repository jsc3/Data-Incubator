"Barbara"
Five rounds, each for time of:
20 Pull-ups
30 Push-ups
40 Sit-ups
50 Squats
Rest precisely three minutes between each round. Post time for each of five rounds to comments.
On July 13, 2003 we introduced the prototype "Barbara." This earlier version allowed five minutes rest between sets. Go back to 030713 and note any improvements today in spite of the reduced rest.

How many muscle-ups can you do in thirty minutes?
Take dip to lockout! Post reps to comments.
A CrossFit "Forging Elite Fitness" t-shirt will be awarded for the most consecutive muscle-ups in each of three divisions: open class, women, and Clydesdales (200 + lbs.).
This breaks the three-way tie (Brad H, Robb. W, and Loyd L.) from the CrossFit Journal muscle-up contest! If you still don’t have rings check this out and do as many pull-ups and dips as you can in as few sets as possible in thirty minutes. Don’t let a lack of rings limit your fitness.

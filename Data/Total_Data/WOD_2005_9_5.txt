75 pound Thruster
Pull-ups
With a continuously running clock do one thruster the first minute, two pull-ups the second minute, three thruster the third minute, and four pull-ups the fourth minuteÂ…continuing in this pattern as long as you are able. If your pace falls behind the count, continue to alternate exercises while recording reps for a total of twenty minutes.

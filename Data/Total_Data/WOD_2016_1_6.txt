10-round Tabata squat
Then, 3 attempts at max handstand hold
This Tabata interval is 20 seconds of work followed by 10 seconds of rest for 10 intervals. Remain in the bottom of the squat for every other rest interval (alternate bottom-to-bottom). Perform handstands against a wall and hold for as long as possible. Rest as needed between attempts.
Post number of squats completed, and time for each of the handstand attempts.

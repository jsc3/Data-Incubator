Complete as many reps in 30 minutes as you can of:
Rope Climb
Push-up
The objective here is to climb and push
until you can do neither. Thoroughly exhaust
both functions within 30 minutes. Report the
details of the experience both today and
the effects tomorrow.
Count the number of trips up the rope
(the CrossFit rope is a 13' "shorty") and
the number of push-ups within the half hour.
Remember the CrossFit push-up is a very
rigid body, deep, controlled movement.
No cheating on the push-up!!
Find a swimming hole/pool and pound out 15 fast laps!!

"Fight Gone Bad!"
This is our famous Fight Gone Bad workout. It has been used extensively to prep fighters for the UFC. In this workout you move from each of five stations after a minute. This is a five-minute round from which a one-minute break is allowed before repeating. Weve used this in 3 and 5 round versions. Today is 3 rounds. The stations are:
Wall-ball  20 pound ball, 10 ft target. (Reps)
Sumo deadlift high-pull 75 pounds (Reps)
Box Jump  20 box (Reps)
Push-press 75 pounds (Reps)
Row  calories (Calories)
The clock does not reset or stop between exercises. On call of rotate, the athlete/s must move to next station immediately for good score. One point is given for each rep, except on the rower where each calorie is one point.

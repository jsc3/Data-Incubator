Five rounds for time of:
12 Handstand push-ups
24 "Short-rope" jumps
Post time to comments.
The "Short-rope" jump is normal rope skipping done with a rope no longer than body length. You'll need to bring your knees high and swing your arms wide to get the rope beneath your feet. The extra work takes its toll. Only count reps that pass under without contacting your feet. (Thanks to HQ's Kevin Johnson)

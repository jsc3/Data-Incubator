Tabata Squats
Post total score from all three efforts in comments. E.G., 21+16+19=56.
There are three variations to our “wall ball” family of exercises. The first, or “original”, familiar to all our regulars, is basically a front squat/push press combo that launches the ball towards the target. This move begins and ends in a squat. The second, or “overhead” throw is an overhead whole body throw. It begins with a powerful whole body arch sending the ball behind the head with the back and hips hyperextending, then the athlete hurls the ball forward and overhead towards the target. The third exercise, or “backwards” throw, is a reverse whole body throw in which the athlete turns his back to the target and drives the ball overhead and backwards towards the target.

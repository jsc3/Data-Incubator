10 “Windshield Wipers”
Tuesday, July 22 shows Loyd doing a “Windshield Wiper”. Both left and right positions constitute a single rep. If you can’t do the Wipers, struggle with them anyways for ten minutes before and after the deadlifts.
For deadlift use alternate grip, hook grip, parallel grips, whatever, don’t let go. Don’t speed up.

Work at a pace that allows for max load. Complete each round of pull-ups in as few sets as possible.
The load for the presses should increase from the shoulder press to the push press to the push jerk. The progression of these presses is from lesser to greater functionality, max load, metabolic stimulus, and total body involvement.
